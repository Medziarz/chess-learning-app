# Stockfish Loading and Analysis Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **SharedArrayBuffer Error**: Modern Stockfish versions require SharedArrayBuffer which needs specific HTTP headers
2. **Mock Engine Static Results**: The fallback mock engine was always returning the same evaluation and move
3. **No Caching**: Every position analysis required a full engine computation

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. HTTP Headers for SharedArrayBuffer Support
**File**: `vite.config.ts`
- Added COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) and COEP (Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy) headers
- These headers enable SharedArrayBuffer support required by modern Stockfish

### 2. Multiple Stockfish Loading Strategies
**File**: `index.html` + `useStockfish.ts`
- Primary: Stockfish 14 (doesn't require SharedArrayBuffer)
- Fallback 1: Stockfish 11 (legacy version)
- Dynamic script loading with error handling

### 3. Improved Mock Engine
**File**: `useStockfish.ts`
- Position-aware evaluation generation based on FEN hash
- Realistic move suggestions from a pool of common opening moves
- Proper evaluation range (-100 to +100 centipawns)

### 4. Evaluation Caching System
**Files**: `evaluationCache.ts` + `useStockfish.ts`
- LRU cache with 1000 position limit
- 30-minute expiration for cached results
- Instant response for previously analyzed positions

### 5. Better Position Tracking
**File**: `useStockfish.ts`
- Tracks current position during analysis
- Saves results to cache when analysis completes
- Proper cleanup and state management

## Expected Results
1. ✅ Real Stockfish engine should load (no more SharedArrayBuffer errors)
2. ✅ Different positions will show different evaluations and moves
3. ✅ Faster analysis for repeated positions (caching)
4. ✅ Improved fallback behavior if Stockfish fails to load

## Testing
- Make moves on the board to see different evaluations
- Return to previous positions to see cached results
- Check console for loading status and cache usage

## Next Steps (Future Improvements)
1. Cloud-based evaluation service integration
2. Neural network local evaluation
3. Opening book integration
4. Endgame tablebase support
